// This file previously contained database actions (addStuff, editStuff, deleteStuff, createUser, changePassword)
// related to an older schema and authentication setup.
// User creation/linking is now handled by NextAuth and the Prisma Adapter.
// Specific actions for new models (Club, Event, RSVP, etc.) should be implemented
// within their respective API route handlers or dedicated service functions.

// Keeping the file for potential future use with appropriate, updated actions if needed.
